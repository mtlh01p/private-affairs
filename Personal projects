My projects so far:
1. Train announcement. A Tkinter program (based on Python) that shows the message of announcements onboard the LRT Jabodebek. This is just fun.
2. Power draw calculator (used by SoCs, just theoretical)
3. School event websites (cccup.id is official website of CC Cup 2023, before August 2024)
4. School event apps (CC Cup 2023, available still on Google Play, though the database no longer exists).
5. OBS Studio Controller. Using Python to control keyboard shortcuts, automating elements on OBS Studio (specifically made scenes).
